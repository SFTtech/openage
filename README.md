============================================================

**openage**: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of *Age of Empires II*,
primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as **GNU/Linux**,
comparable in its goals to projects like [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/), [OpenRA](http://openra.net/), [OpenTTD](http://openttd.org/) and [OpenRCT2](http://openrct.net/)

openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them.
To play, you require *an original AoE II : TC installation or [AoE II: HD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/)*
([Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) is your friend; in the near future, setup discs will be supported).

The foundation of **openage**:

Technology     | Component
---------------|----------
**C++14**      | Engine core
**Python3**    | Scripting, media conversion, in-game console, code generation
**Cython**     | Glue code
**CMake**      | Build system
**OpenGL2.1**  | Rendering, shaders
**SDL2**       | Cross-platform Audio/Input/Window handling
**Opus**       | Audio codec
**Humans**     | Mixing together all of the above

Our goals *include*:

* Fully authentic look and feel
  * This can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented,
    and guessing/experimenting can only get you this close
  * We will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)
* Multiplayer (obviously)
* Matchmaking and ranking with a [haskell masterserver](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-masterserver)
* Optionally, [improvements](/doc/ideas/) over the original game
* AI scripting in Python, you can use [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
* Re-creating [free game assets](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage-data)
* An easily-moddable content format: **nyan**'s yet another notation
* A powerful integrated Python console and interface, comparable to [blender](http://blender.org/)

But beware, for sanity reasons:

* No network compatibility with the original game.
  You really wanna have the same problems again?
* No binary compatibility with the original game.
  A one-way script to convert maps/savegames/missions to openage is planned though.


Current State of the Project
----------------------------

 - What features are currently implemented?
   - See [doc/status.md](/doc/status.md).

 - What can I do once I start the game?
   - See [docs/usage.md](/doc/usage.md).

 - What's the plan?
   - See [doc/milestones.md](/doc/milestones.md). We also have a [list of crazy xor good ideas](/doc/ideas).


Dependencies, Building and Running
----------------------------------

 - How do I get this to run on my box?
   - See [doc/building.md](/doc/building.md).

 - I compiled everything. Now how do I run it?
   - Execute `./run`, you will be prompted by [the convert script](/doc/media_convert.md) to convert the original game assets to the (a lot saner and more moddable) openage format. The game starts when this is done..

 - Waaaaaah! It
   - segfaults
   - prints error messages I don't want to read
   - ate my dog

All of those are features, not bugs.

To turn them off, use `./run --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dog`.


If this still does not help, try the [contact section](#contact)
or the [bug tracker](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues).

ATM, openage is mostly designed to be built and run inside the development folder via `make run`, `./run`, `./run.py` or `python3 -m openage` (those all are equivalent), but `make install` might actually work!

To run the globally installed version: `python3 -m openage`.


Development Process
-------------------

What does openage development look like in practice?
 - extensive [syncronization](#contact)!
 - [doc/development.md](/doc/development.md).

Can I help?
 - [doc/contributing.md](/doc/contributing.md).


All documentation is also in this repo:

- Code documentation is embedded in the sources for Doxygen (see [doc readme](/doc/README.md)).
- Have a look at the [doc directory](/doc/). This folder tends to outdate when code changes.


Windows Version
---------------

None of us uses Windows, so a port has low priority.

However, we're using cross-platform libraries wherever possible,
so a port should be pretty easy to accomplish.
We'll eventually look into porting using `mingw64`/`msys2`.

If you want to beat us to it, go for it!

We'd prefer as few preprocessor switches as possible, keep those centralized.


Contributing
============

* Being typical computer science students, we hate people.
* Please don't contact us.
* Nobody likes Age of Empires anyway.
* None of you is interested in making openage more awesome anyway.
* We don't want a community.
* Don't even think about trying to help.

Guidelines:

* No **bugreports** or **feature requests**, the game is perfect as is.
* Don't try to **fix any bugs**, see above.
* Don't implement any features, your code is crap.
* Don't even think about sending a **pull request**.
* Please ignore the [easy tasks](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22easy%22) that [could just be done](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is:issue+is:open+label:%22just+do+it%22).
* Absolutely never ever participate in this [boring community](https://www.reddit.com/r/openage/).
* Don't note the irony, you idiot.

To prevent accidential violation of one of those guidelines, you should *never*

* [learn git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics)
* [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* [learn python](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)
* [learn c++14](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
* read the code and documentation
* [contribute](/doc/contributing.md) anything to the code
* [contact us](#contact)

cheers, happy hecking.
