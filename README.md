openage
=======

**openage**: a volunteer project to create a free engine clone of *Age of Empires II*,
primarily aimed at POSIX platforms such as **GNU/Linux**,
comparable in its goals to projects like [OpenMW](https://openmw.org/), [OpenRA](http://openra.net/) and [OpenTTD](http://openttd.org/).

openage uses the original game assets (such as sounds and graphics), but (for obvious reasons) doesn't ship them.
To play, you require *an original AoE II installation or [AoE II: HD](http://store.steampowered.com/app/221380/)* (wine is your friend; in the near future, setup discs will be supported).

The foundation of **openage**:

Technology     | Component
---------------|----------
**C++14**      | Engine core
**Python**     | Scripting, media conversion, in-game console, code generation
**CMake**      | Build system
**OpenGL2.1**  | Rendering, shaders
**SDL2**       | Cross-platform Audio/Input/Window handling
**Opus**       | Audio codec
**Humans**     | Mixing together all of the above

Our goals *include*:

* Fully authentic look and feel
  * This can only be approximated, since the behaviour of the original game is mostly undocumented,
    and guessing/experimenting can only get you this close
  * We will not implement useless artificial limitations (max 30 selectable units...)
* Multiplayer (obviously)
* Optionally, [Improvements](/doc/ideas/) over the original game
* AI
* Re-creating free game assets
* An easily-moddable content format
* A powerful integrated Python console and interface, comparable to [blender](http://blender.org/)

Our goals specifically *exclude*:

* Network compatibility with the original game.
  You really wanna have the same problems again?
* Binary compatibility with the original game.
  A one-way script to convert maps/savegames/missions to openage is planned though.


Current State of the Project
----------------------------

 - What features are currently implemented?

See [doc/status.md](/doc/status.md).

 - What can I do once I start the game?

See [docs/usage.md](/doc/usage.md).

 - What's the plan?

See [doc/milestones.md](/doc/milestones.md). We also have a [list of crazy xor good ideas](/doc/ideas).

Dependencies, Building and Running
----------------------------------

 - How do I get this to run on my box?

See [doc/building.md](/doc/building.md).

 - I compiled everything. Now how do I run it?

You first need to use [the convert script](/doc/media_convert.md) (will be automated in the near future!) to convert the original game assets to the (a lot saner and more moddable) openage format. Then, you can simply run the game using `./openage --data=assets`.

 - Waaaaaah! It
  - segfaults
  - prints error messages I don't want to read
  - ate my dog

All of those are features, not bugs.
To turn them off, use `./openage --dont-segfault --no-errors --dont-eat-dog`.

If this still does not help, try the [contact section](#contact)
or the [bug tracker](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues).

Development Process
-------------------

* How does openage development look in practice?
  * Awesome.

* Can I help?
  * Yes, please!

See [doc/development.md](/doc/development.md).


Project documentation is accompanying the source code in the `doc/` folder:

- Have a look at the [doc directory](/doc/).
- We use Doxygen, as described in the [doc readme](/doc/README.md)
- Have a look at the source.


Windows Version
---------------

None of us uses Windows, so a port has low priority.

However, we're using cross-platform libraries wherever possible, so a port should be pretty easy to accomplish. We'll eventually look into porting using `mingw32`/`mingw64` or maybe `cygwin`.

If you want to beat us to it, go for it!
We'd prefer as few preprocessor switches as possible, preferably they should all be placed in a few 'cross-platform abstraction files' (just talk to us for details...).

Contributing
============

* Being typical computer science students, we hate people.
* Please don't contact us.
* Nobody likes Age of Empires anyway.
* None of you is interested in making openage more awesome anyway.
* We don't want a community.
* Don't even think about trying to help.

Guidelines:

* No **bugreports** or **feature requests**, the game is perfect as is.
* Don't try to **fix any bugs**, see above.
* Don't implement any features, your code is crap.
* Don't even think about sending a **pull request**
* Don't note the irony, you idiot
* We even have a [list of tasks](/doc/tasks.md) that definitely don't need your work.

To prevent accidential violation of one of those guidelines, you should *never*

* [learn git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Basics)
* [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)
* [learn python](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/appetite.html)
* [learn c++14](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
* read the code and documentation
* contribute anything to the code
* [contact us](#contact)

cheers, happy hecking.

Contact
-------

Most of us hang around on our **IRC** channel (`#sfttech` on `freenode.net`).
Do not hesitate to ping us, we probably won't notice you otherwise.

There's no openage mailing list, but the github issue tracker comes pretty close to it: Everybody who 'watches' the repository will receive all the issue tracker posts via mail, and can even conveniently reply via their mail client. In addition, all the issue tracker discussions are auto-posted to the IRC channel. Feel free to use the issue tracker for any sorts of discussion, proposal or questions that the IRC is unsuitable for.

I know that probably nobody is ever gonna look at the `copying.md` file,
but if you want to contribute code to openage, please take the time to
skim through it and add yourself to the authors list.
