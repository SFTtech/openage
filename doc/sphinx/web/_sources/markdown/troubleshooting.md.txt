# Troubleshooting

## Asset Conversion

### Conversion fails when converting from *AoE II: HD Edition*

The newer versions of the HD Edition use another asset format. You need to have **Patch level 4.3** to successfully convert the assets. You can change the patch level by doing this:

1. Right-Click on Age of Empires 2: HD Edition in your games section
2. Select "Properties"
3. Select "Betas"
4. The beta you want to opt into is "patch43 - Patch 4.3"

After you've selected the beta program, wait for Steam to download the files and try converting again.

### Conversion fails for *The Conquerors* 1.0c

Make sure you don't have *UserPatch*, compatibility patches or modifications installed that make changes to the original asset files.

## Ingame

### UI elements are visible but the background stays black

openage does not start a game by default on startup. Press the "generate game" button on the left or, if the game has not finished loading the assets, tick the checkbox marked with "create_when_ready".
