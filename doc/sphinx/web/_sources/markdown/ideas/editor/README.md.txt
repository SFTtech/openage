## Editor doc structure

* **Terrain editor** -  for all your terrain editing needs. Your favourite TV show ten years ago was Bob the Builder? Then go ahead and look what tools he has in [terrain.md](terrain.md)!
* **Economy editor** - discover the communist in yourself! In contrast to real life everything works as expected - so plan the economy in [economy.md](economy.md)!
* **Script editor** - you don't need to believe in god. You ARE god. Set your evil mind free in [scripting.md](scripting.md)
* **Campaign editor** - You're fed up with low-quality campaigns that you've known for years? You think the original tutorial campaign doesn't quite cut it? Your search is over - read [campaigns.md](campaigns.md) now!
* **Unit editor** - Everyone's favourite tool to create cats in nyan. Bonus points for correct unit music. Listen to it at [units.md](units.md).
* **Tech editor** - because having nuclear weapons in the middle age is not ignorant and totally not the point of this game. It's freakin *gnarly*. See how you can make your own weapons of math instruction at [tech.md](tech.md)
* **Multiplayer Mode** - are you tired of working on maps all by yourself? do you want others to do your editing work for you? Fear no more and embrace *massive multiplayer online editor mode* (MMOEM) by looking inside [multiplayer.md](multiplayer.md).

## General
* It doesn't matter if the engine doesn't implement feature X. Don't you **dare** implementing something in the engine that isn't in the editor already!
* If the editor produces invalid files, fix the engine. No exceptions.
* Remember general attitude: bugs are features, and bugreports are for losers ONLY.
* In case it isn't completely evident: if you've missed the irony, you should go and repair your laugh box.
