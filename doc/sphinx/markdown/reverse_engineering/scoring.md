# Score system

## Age of Empires I

The score is based on 5 categories: military, economy, religion, technology and
survival/wonders.

In case of equality there should not be any player that gets a bonus for the
largest number. However, the game engine does pick one player that gets the
bonus. The player that gets the bonus is defined by a couple of factors:

* If player X gets the largest number before player Y does, X gets the bonus
  before Y does and keeps the bonus.
* If both players get the largest number at the same gametick the player with
  the lowest index (i.e. the game engine's internal assigned identifier) gets
  the bonus.
