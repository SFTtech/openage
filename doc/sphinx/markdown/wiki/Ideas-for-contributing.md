**An overview of what is currently going on in openage is [the project planning](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/projects)** and of course the [pull requests](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/pulls).

Our projects consist of tasks. Tasks are organized in the issue tracker.

There are:
* [tasks that can be started right away](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22just+do+it%22)
* [tasks that need more design work first](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aproposal)

If you have new ideas yourself, for things that need optimizations, are bugs or whatever, create new issues.
If in doubt, look at our [contributing guide](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/blob/master/doc/contributing.md).
