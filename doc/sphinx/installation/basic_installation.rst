Basic Installation
------------------

.. note::

    The following instructions will help you to install a packaged version of openage
    on your computer. If you have problems with that please take a look into  :doc:`../../build_instructions/packages`.



Linux Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide packages for different Linux distributions. Please take a
look for distribution packages at `Repology <https://repology.org/project/openage/packages>`_ or
`Bintray <https://bintray.com/simonsan/openage-packages/openage-linux-releases>`_ for any future updates on *.deb
and AppImage packages.


Windows Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

We provide both installer and portable packages for Windows 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The latest
release installer you find at `Github <https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/releases>`_. Our nightly builds you
will find over `here <https://dl.bintray.com/simonsan/openage-packages>`_.


macOS Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For MacOSX we don't have packages, but it should build fine. Here you can check the
`build status <https://travis-ci.com/simonsan/openage.svg?branch=master>`_, while the instructions for
:ref:`dep-install` should help you with finding out what you need to get openage building.
