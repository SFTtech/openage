The override stops when another terrain overlay override is initiated, the overridden `OverlayTerrain` ability is deactivated or the override terrain is the same as the default overlayed terrain of the ability.

## aux.progress.specialization.TerrainProgress

```python
TerrainProgress(Progress):
    terrain : Terrain
```

Changes the underlying terrain of a game entity when the specified progress has been reached.

The new terrain that will be permanently placed under the game entity.

## aux.progress.type.CarryProgress

```python

The `Progress` objects are stored in a `Damageable` ability which specifies the type of attribute that is monitored. When the attribute value is equal to `max_value` of the attribute defined by the game entity, the progress is 0\%. Once the attribute value reaches the `min_value`, the progress is 100\%.

## aux.progress.type.HarvestProgress

```python

```

Monitors the harvesting progress of a resource spot stored by a `Harvestable` ability. A resource spot with full capacity has a progress of 0\% and a fully harvested resource spot a progress of 100\%.

## aux.progress.type.RestockProgress

```python
RestockProgress(Progress):
```

Monitors the restock progress of a restockable resource spot stored by a `Harvestable` ability. The restocking progress is initiated by the `Restock` ability of another game entity. At the start of the restocking process, the progress is 0\%. After the restocking has finished, the progress is 100\%.

Restocking progress is only tracked between the start and end of restock process. Therefore, state changes initiated by `RestockProgress` objects of type `StateChangerProgress` will be deactivated after the progress reaches 100\%.

## aux.progress.type.TransformProgress

```python
TransformProgress(Progress):
```

Monitors the progress of a transformation initiated by a `TransformTo` ability. At the start of the transformation, the progress is 0\%. After the transformation has finished, the progress is 100\%.

Transformation progress is only tracked between the start and end of transformation. Therefore, state changes initiated by `TransformProgress` objects of type `StateChangerProgress` will be deactivated after the progress reaches 100\%.

* Static amounts can be acquired like normal resources
* Temporary amounts that can be provided by game entities with `ProvideContingent`

By using the contingent (see `UseContingent` ability), the current amount of resources is not reduced. Instead, the game entity will reserve parts of the contingent until it loses the ability or dies. When the whole contingent is reserved, no more game entities using it can be created.

Contingents can be utilized to implement mechanics like Population Space (AoE2) or Supply (Starcraft).

Note that it is also allowed to spend the static amounts determining the contingent size like normal resources.

**harvestable_by_default**
Determines whether the resource spot is harvestable when it is created. If `true`, the resource spot will be accessible without any conditions as long as the corresponding `Harvestable` ability of the game entity is enabled. When set to false, the resource spot must be activated with a `MakeHarvestable` effect. The conditions under which the activation succeeds are decided by the `MakeHarvestable` resistance of the game entity the resource spot belongs to.
