COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF ALL COORDINATE SYSTEMS

phys2/phys3
	Physics coordinates
	orthonormal 2D/3D (NE, SE)/(NE, SE, UP), in tu/teu
	fixed-point integer with a 16-bit fractional part

	origin is in the west corner of tile (0, 0) (at sea level),
	and the west corner of chunk (0, 0)
	positive in NE, SE, UP directions

	a unit at (0.5, 0.5) stands at the center of tile (0, 0)
	a unit at (8, 8) stands at the center of chunk (0, 0)

	NE: north-east, in tu (terrain length unit)
	SE: south-east, in tu (terrain length unit)
	UP: guess what, in teu (terrain elevation unit)

	we believe that 1 teu = 1 tu / sqrt(8) (from aspect ration calculations)
	the actual relation is pretty irrelevant, though.

	given in these systems:
		Camera
		Units
		Projectiles

tile/tile3
	Tile coordinates
	orthonormal 2D/3D (NE, SE)/(NE, SE, UP), integer, in tu/teu

	identical to phys2/phys3 systems, but uses integers

	given in these systems:
		Terrain tiles
		Buildings

chunk
	Chunk coordinates
	orthonormal 2D (NE, SE), integer, in 16tu/16teu

	similar to tile system, but describes chunks of 16x16 tiles

	given in these systems:
		Chunks

window
	Window coordinates
	orthonormal 2D (x, y), integer, in pixels

	origin is top left corner of window
	positive in right and down directions

	given in this system:
		SDL mouse
		OpenGL viewport

camgame
	game camera coordinates
	orthonormal 2D (x, y), integer, in pixels

	origin is center of window
	positive in right and up directions

	while in game rendering mode, the renderer accepts
	coordinates of this type.

camhud
	game camera coordinates
	orthonormal 2D (x, y), integer, in pixels

	origin is bottom left corner of window
	positive in right and up directions

	while in hud rendering mode, the renderer accepts
	coordinates of this type.



CONVERSIONS


for rendering
	depending on whether objects are rendered as part of hud or by the game
	camera, their coordinates are transformed to camgame or camhud

for input processing
	again depending on whether inputs were aimed at an HUD object or an
	entity rendered by the game camera, they (i.e. mouse clicks) are
	transformed to camgame or camhud.
	camgame coordinates can then further be converted to phys coordinates,
	for mapping the inputs to physics objects.

	idea: HUD drawing code will register HUD objects with the engine
	the engine then memorizes the areas where HUD objects are drawn,
	and checks whether the mouse click lies within one of the rectangles
