# Procedure for Microsoft Windows users (Windows 10)

__NOTE:__ We also have an installer for Win10 (x64), if you just want to play around with *openage* you can find it [here](https://github.com/SFTtech/openage/releases).

 Since Windows doesn't offer a native package manager, we use a mixture of manual and automated steps to get the dependencies for openage.
 *Please remember to replace the directories referenced below (written in <...>) with the appropriate values.*

## Using CI to build openage
If you use any CI (like Travis-CI or Appveyor) you can make your life easier by using the following yaml-configuration files:
- Win_x64 - MSVC 15.x - [> Download .yml <](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonsan/4c73314e005239938110ec9c91e484c0/raw/)
- Win_x86 - MSVC 15.x - [> Download .yml <](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/simonsan/390f2e3f60667608f74a2ed687e14dad/raw/)

They will build you the latest version from our master branch and package them into an installer and a portable 7z-file.

__NOTE:__ You need to manually make sure and doublecheck if the system you are building on has fulfilled all the [dependencies](/doc/building.md).

## Setting up the build environment
 You will need to download and install the following manually.
 Those who already have the latest stable versions of these programs can skip this:
 - [Visual Studio Buildtools](https://download.visualstudio.microsoft.com/download/pr/10413969-2070-40ea-a0ca-30f10ec01d1d/414d8e358a8c44dc56cdac752576b402/vs_buildtools.exe)
   - With the "Visual C++ Buildtools" workload.

    _NOTE:_ If you are searching for an IDE for development you can get an overview [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#C/C++), we've also written some [instructions for developing with different IDEs](/doc/ide/README.md).

 - [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/)
   - With the "pip" option enabled. We use `pip` to install other dependencies.
   - With the "Precompile standard library" option enabled.
   - With the "Download debug binaries (...)" option enabled.
   - If in doubt, run the installer again and choose "Modify".
   - You are going to need the 64-bit version of python if you are planning to build the 64-bit version of openage, and vice versa.

 - [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

### Python Modules
 Open a command prompt at `<Python 3 installation directory>/Scripts`

    pip install cython numpy lz4 toml pillow pygments pyreadline3 Jinja2

_Note:_ Make sure the Python 3 instance you're installing these scripts for is the one you call `python` in CMD
_Note:_ Also ensure that `python` and `python3` both point to the correct and the same version of Python 3

### vcpkg packages
 Set up [vcpkg](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg#quick-start). Open a command prompt at `<vcpkg directory>`

    vcpkg install dirent eigen3 fontconfig freetype harfbuzz libepoxy libogg libpng opus opusfile qtbase qtdeclarative sdl2 sdl2-image toml11

 _Note:_ The `qt6` port in vcpkg has been split into multiple packages, build times are acceptable now.
 If you want, you can still use [the prebuilt version](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/) instead.
 If you do so, include `-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=<QT6 directory>` in the cmake configure command.

 _Note:_ If you are planning to build the 64-bit version of openage, you are going to need 64-bit libraries. Add command line option `--triplet x64-windows` to the above command or add the environment variable `VCPKG_DEFAULT_TRIPLET=x64-windows` to build x64 libraries. [See here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg/issues/1254)

__NOTE:__ You can also download the pre-built vcpkg dependencies (without Qt) [from this repository](https://github.com/simonsan/openage-win-dependencies/releases).

## Building openage
 Note that openage doesn't support completely out-of-source-tree builds yet.
 We will, however, use a separate `build` directory to build the binaries.

_Note:_ You will also need to set up [the dependencies for Nyan](https://github.com/SFTtech/nyan/blob/master/doc/building.md#windows), which is mainly [flex](https://sourceforge.net/projects/winflexbison/)

Open a command prompt at `<openage directory>`:

     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=<vcpkg directory>\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake ..
     cmake --build . --config RelWithDebInfo -- /nologo /m /v:m

_Note:_ If you want to build the x64 version, please add `-G "Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64"` (for VS2017) or `-G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64` (for VS2019) to the first cmake command.

_Note:_ If you want to download and build Nyan automatically add `-DDOWNLOAD_NYAN=YES -DFLEX_EXECUTABLE=<path to win_flex.exe>` to the first cmake command.

## Running openage (in devmode)
 While this is straightforward on other platforms, there is still stuff to do to run openage on Windows:
  - Install the [DejaVu Book Font](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/Download.html).
    - Download and extract the latest `dejavu-fonts-ttf` tarball/zip file.
    - Select all `ttf\DejaVuSerif*.ttf` files, right click and click `Install for all users`.

    _Note:_ This will require administrator rights.
    - Set the `FONTCONFIG_PATH` environment variable to `<vcpkg directory>\installed\<relevant config>\tools\fontconfig\fonts\`.
    - Copy `fontconfig\57-dejavu-serif.conf` to `%FONTCONFIG_PATH%\conf.d`.
  - [Optional] Set the `AGE2DIR` environment variable to the AoE 2 installation directory.
  - Set `QML2_IMPORT_PATH` to `<vcpkg directory>\installed\<relevant config>\qml` or for prebuilt Qt `<qt directory>\<qt-version>\<compiler-version>\qml`
  - openage needs these DLL files to run:
    - `openage.dll` (Usually in `<openage directory>\build\libopenage\<config built>`.)
    - `nyan.dll` (The location depends on the procedure chosen to get nyan.)
    - DLLs from vcpkg-installed dependencies. Normally, these DLLs should be copied to `<openage directory>\build\libopenage\<config built>` during the build process. If they are not, you can find them in `<vcpkg directory>\installed\<relevant config>\bin`.
      - If prebuilt QT6 was installed, the original location of QT6 DLLs is `<QT6 directory>\bin`.

  - Now, to run the openage:
    - Open a CMD window in `<openage directory>\build\` and run `python -m openage game`
    - Execute`<openage directory>\build\run.exe` every time after that and enjoy!

## Packaging

 - Install [NSIS](https://sourceforge.net/projects/nsis/files/latest/download).
 - Depending on the way you installed Qt (vcpkg/pre-built) you need to edit the following line in `<openage-repo-dir>\buildsystem\templates\ForwardVariables.cmake.in`:
```
	# Use windeploy for packaging qt-prebuilt, standard value '1' for windeploy, '0' for vcpkg
	set(use_windeployqt 1)
```

 Open a command prompt at `<openage directory>\build` (or use the one from the building step):

    cpack -C RelWithDebInfo

 The installer (`openage-<version>-<arch>.exe`) will be generated in the same directory.<br>

 _Hint:_ Append `-V` to the `cpack` command for verbose output (it takes time to package all dependencies).

 _Hint:_ <arch> you can set with the environment variable `TARGET_PLATFORM` (e.g. amd64, x86).
