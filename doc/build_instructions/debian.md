# Possible prerequisites for Debian

Here are some packages, I installed along the way. I’ve no idea if the list below is minimal nor complete, but hopefully it still helps…

`build-essential libopusfile-dev libopus-dev libgoogle-perftools-dev build-essential doxygen graphviz opus-tools-dbg libharfbuzz* libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-dev python3-pip python3-dev libpython libpng-dev freetype2-demos libepoxy-dev fontconfig libgl1-mesa-dev qt5-qmake qt5-default qtbase5-dev qttools5-dev-tools qtdeclarative5-dev qml-module-qtquick-controls qml-module-qtquick-dialogs`

In addition you may also want to [get backtrace](https://wiki.debian.org/HowToGetABacktrace) for gcc.

Now `./configure` and `make` should run through.
