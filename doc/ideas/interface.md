As opposed to the gameplay improvements, these interface enhancements are pretty straightforward, so they will probably be hard-coded in.

 - Allow selecting more than 30 units (duh.)
 - Allow more than 10 groups (prefixes?)
 - Set default behaviour for units
 - Better re-grouping
  - Intelligent assigning of new units to existing groups
  - Sub-group selections
 - Customizable hotkeys for *everything*
 - possibility to set rally points on moving units
 - show a symbol on a unit, which is the target of a conversion (e.g. empire earth)


after-game stats
---------

 - by looking at stats it should be clear how many kills were just selfinflicted kills (by siege units, deleting idle vills, etc...) and how many were actual opponent kills
 - what was the lumberjack/farmer/miner/trade cart composition during game
   - maybe a slider in the timeline trend with MIN/MAX values shown
   - would be beneficial both to casters and to gamers who wish to improve on their skill
   - having a concise aftergame analysis tool would be quite welcome
     - maybe also worth a talk to the people from siege engineers and rec analysis for possible integration as game analysis tools?
