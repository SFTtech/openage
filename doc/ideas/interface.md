As opposed to the gameplay improvements, these interface enhancements are pretty straightforward, so they will probably be hard-coded in.

 - Allow the selection of more than 30 units.
 - Allow more than 10 groups. (prefixes?)
 - Set default behaviour for units.
 - Better re-grouping.
  - Intelligent assigning of new units to existing groups.
  - Sub-group selections.
 - Customizable hotkeys for *everything*.
