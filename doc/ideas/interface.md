# Interface

## interface enhancements
As opposed to the gameplay improvements, these interface enhancements are pretty straightforward, so they will probably be hard-coded in.

 - Allow selecting more than 30 units (duh.)
 - Allow more than 10 groups (prefixes?)
 - Set default behaviour for units
 - Better re-grouping
  - Intelligent assigning of new units to existing groups
  - Sub-group selections
 - Customizable hotkeys for *everything*
 - possibility to set rally points on moving units
 - show a symbol on a unit, which is the target of a conversion (e.g. empire earth)
 - Zoom
   - possible options "Zoom in center of screen", "Zoom towards mouse cursor" or "zoom towards selected units" (to figure out what makes sense in which situations)


## after-game stats

 - by looking at stats it should be clear how many kills were just friendly fire kills (by siege units, deleting idle vills, etc...) and how many were actual opponent kills
 - what was the lumberjack/farmer/miner/trade cart composition during game
   - maybe a slider in the timeline trend with MIN/MAX values shown
   - would be beneficial both to casters and to gamers who wish to improve on their skill
   - having a concise aftergame analysis tool would be quite welcome
