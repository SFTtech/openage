This file contains ideas to "enhance" the original Age of Kings gameplay. Don't worry, vanilla mode will always be available.

Weather
-------

 - Change view distance (Line of sight / Fog of War)
 - Fog, rain, winter, summer
 - Unit slowdowns (depending on terrain)
 - Can be predicted by tech
 - Can be modified globally or locally (by voodoo priests)

Fire
----

Buildings made out of wood and other flammable material can be lit.
Fire departments in the city can extinguish those fires (Stronghold anybody?).

Day/night cycle
---------------

At night: View distance reduced, everything darker.
Villagers need sleep, otherwise they die at work.


3D terrain
----------

Villagers can dig down, can discover natural resources.
Dirt, stone, etc are new resources, can be placed elsewhere
(add any minecraft/terraria-like stuff here)


Infinite maps
-------------

Maps with infinite size! (Your PC is the limit!)
Spherical/Toroidal/Cylindrical surfaces would be possible, too.


MMO games
---------

Play on one single map with 9001 players.

Massively slow down the game speed, and you get a "browser game"-like experience.


Research
--------

 - Only newly-built units receive the bonus when units are upgraded
 - Already-built units need to be "overhauled" for a cost back at the barracks.
   (reminder: just an idea, there will be vanilla mode)
 - Research should be placed in creating order, like in WarCraft. It's too annoying
   to click on building again after each research

Zombie Survival Mode
--------------------

The map has a bunch of zombie spawners; after an initial build-up phase,
they start producing waves zombie hordes, fast zombies, tanks, petard zombies;
the zombie AI tries to get to your villagers (magic pathfinding);
killed units turn into zombies as well. spawners can be destroyed,
but the closer or the more powerful you get, the more zombies will spawn.
To win, survive for a specified period of time, build a wonder,
or destroy the spawners (or something...).


Better movement
---------------

 - Move groups as group, or each unit with its own movement speed
 - Auto-resolution of blocking situations
 - Individual path searching cost for tiles
  - Allow user to mark parts of the map as more expensive
  - Auto-set a higher path cost for tiles in the firing range of an enemy castle
 - Allow setting any number of waypoints (basically an extension of the 'patrol' mechanic)


Lobby settings
--------------

 - Most of the above should be available as lobby settings
 - Boosts/handicaps such as resource multipliers for players
 - Forced no-rush (timelimit or score limit until attacks are possible)


Matchmaking and competitive mode
--------------------------------

 - Some kind of "official" account on servers for everybody
 - Automatic skill groups to create balanced matches
 - We can show the world that competitive games can be free open source!


Bridges
-------

 - Ability to build bridges in water
 - Blocks ships, allows land units to walk
 - Forgotten Empires might already have wooden bridge textures
 - Destructible, repairable, ...
 - Long build time


Team interaction
----------------

 - Better team interaction
 - Work/resource sharing
 - Unit sharing (transport boats)


Unit grouping
-------------

 - Manually coloring units (e.g. for teammates)
 - "Mobile ping": designated unit pings its position periodically
 - Implicite group definitions/reselections


Color marking / signs on map
----------------------------

 - For better team coordination:
   - Create signs
   - Paint on map
   - Create arrows


More intelligent units
----------------------

 - Restrictions for action areas (don't do anything here)
   - Wood chopping
   - Castle rampages
   - Avoid hazardous areas during pathfinding (via a cost modifier)
     - Automatically for stationary hazards (castles, towers, ...)
     - Manually "painted" areas
 - Emergency evacuation points
 - Formations and movement when attacking
 - Dynamic hardlocking on target units when attacking
   - Don't lock on unreachable current target
   - Attack the blocking units first

Infinite Resources
-------------------

 - Forest regeneration

Better attack stances
---------------------

 - Aggressive stance for monks (auto-convert)
 - Auto-flee stance (especially for monks): Auto-task "flee" action as soon as an enemy unit comes near
 - Non-coward stance for villagers
 - Allow selecting the default stance

For the lulz
------------

 - Big fat damage numbers!!!1
 - Friendly-fire toggle!!111
