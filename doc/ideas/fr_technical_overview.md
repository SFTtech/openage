# Technical overview for requested features

These are some thoughts for a feature rich mode. Don't worry, there will be a vanilla mode without all that fancy stuff just feeling as good as this famous 20-years-old game. So every fancy feature changing the gameplay drastically could be also disabled by users.


## Explanations:

1. ITEM: A description of the item
2. COMPLEXITY: subjective evaluation for the complexity of the implementation
3. AFFECTED ENGINE PARTS: core engine modules that needs to be worked on, e.g. renderer, API, converter
4. IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: links to pull requests or dependencies
5. MILESTONE: Which milestone this feature will appear in

Gameplay           | GM1        | Roads on commonly traveled areas allow faster travel. Pathfinding would let the units stay on the road. Appearance and quality depends on traffic (matted grass, dirt path, etc.). Neutral to all players. Turns soft/regular terrains into roads, requires stone, does not work on irregular terrains; grants movement speed to all allied units + passive vision (like a foundation spots units walking over them).

Gameplay           | GM9        | GAIA and terrain interaction, e.g. flock of bird rises up from tree when tree is felled or many people approach, hearable sound indicator, players hear and see birds when someone comes to their woodline at home. Triggered rocks falling of cliffs.
Gameplay           | GM10       | Relics have special abilities (AOM), bonuses for attack and range. Generated randomly. Maybe also rolling relics with ranged attributes to bring into battle.

Gameplay           | GM16       | Buildings can be captured when damaged to 20% or less. Player who repairs over 20% owns the building. New units can be produced out of this captured building from 50% on.

Gameplay           | GM19       | Scale wonder cost to max pop, number of players and available resources.
Gameplay           | GM20       | A new 5th "free trade" age where allies share resources and give each other massive battles.

Gameplay           | GM22       | Researches can be globally and locally applied. e.g. upgrade just units garrisoned in the barracks for less research cost; e.g. you need 3 pikemen for the battle now, but you don't want to produce them in the future in masses (see GM18)
Gameplay           | GM23       | Units can level up by gaining experience doing what they normally do, fighting in battle against their counter unit will give more XP against that unit style.

Gameplay           | GM30       | Unit queuing doesn't block resources. Resources are taken in account, when the unit is actually starting to be produced.
Gameplay           | GM31       | Make denying upgrades more easy, like in SC2. Often players will destroy buildings to cancel an upgrade in progress and gain the upgrade advantage. Maybe in a special mod with less hp for buildings.

Gameplay           | GM35       | Controlled forest fires: Allows the player (technology researched at the university in the castle age) to destroy forests to create more space; this goes much faster/efficient than chopping, but obviously at the expense of the lumber and generates regular terrain.
