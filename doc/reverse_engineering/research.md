The following information stems from the internet (tm) and is thus utterly 100-% correct.

Buildings have exactly one sprite.
	Exception: e.g. town center, which has multiple sprites for different sections (walkable...)

Units have 5 states: idle, walking, attacking, dying, rotting. for each state, there is a sprite for every direction the unit could be facing.
	Exception: villagers, ofc, have a lot more states.
	Ships have extra sprites for their sails.
