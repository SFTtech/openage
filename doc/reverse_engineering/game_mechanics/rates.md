# Rates

This file lists some rates used in AoE2

# Animals

Sheep and deer rot at rate of `1 food / 2 seconds`.
Shepherds get food at `10 food / 12 seconds` (one every 0.8333 seconds).

# Relics

Relics give gold at rate of `1 every 2 / (number of relics) seconds`. Since one
can get a maximum of 10 relics, this means they can provide at most 5 gold per
second.
