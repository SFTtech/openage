## Line of Sight

Line of sight depends on the selected difficulty of the game.

    Easiest   4  tiles
    Standard  6  tiles
    Moderate  12 tiles
    Hard      12 tiles
    Hardest   12 tiles

As soon as a unit moves into the LOS of a wolf, he will chase and attack the unit. However some unit types are ignored, including:

* King
* Trade Cart
* War Elephant
* Teutonic Knight
* War Waggon
* Monk
* All siege units
* Scout (but light cavalry and hussars will be attacked)
* Sheep (as comical as it sounds)

These units have to attack the wolf first, before they are chased and attacked.

## Balancing

Under normal circumstances a villager without "Loom" will always lose to a wolf. Even if the villager is the first to hit, the wolf should have at least 1 HP left.
