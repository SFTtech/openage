Improvements for the AI's gameplay

Villagers
---------

 - Don't collect resources in hazardous areas / send the military to clear them out
 - Send military task forces to guard strategic resources / tower them
 - Don't build in hazardous areas
 - Build more gates in walls to prevent lock-ins
 - Prefer to build castles and towers near the water/thin places
 - Create more trade cogs and trade ships

Military
--------

 - Avoid fighting in hazardous areas / prefer fighting in range of own castles
 - Coordinates reaction to attacks on units (during march, ...) (including attacks by towers/castles)
 - Disable scouting if the "all visible" option was selected.
 - Lame you (steal boar in the beginning on purpose)
 - Understand, how to do economic damage
   - e.g. if losing of all AI-units is inevitable, run and attack villagers to hurt economy
 - don't wait for hours to mass up army and then try to overrun you at minute 40
   - send smaller amount of troops earlier in the game to annoy you
   - while building up a big army in the back
