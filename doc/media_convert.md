How to use the original game assets?
------------------------------------

Openage currently depends on the original game assets, so you need a copy of the *original AoE II or AoE II: HD*.
The original AoE:TC game asset formats are, lets say, "special", so they need to be converted in order to be usable from openage.
That conversion is performed by the openage.convert python module; as of writing this text, you need to start the conversion manually.


Convert script invocation
-------------------------

To convert only media files we need at the moment, execute this:

	make media AGE2DIR="~/.wine-age/drive_c/programs/ms-games/aoe2"

Or convert media from a Windows mount (example of AoE II: HD via Steam).

	make media AGE2DIR="/var/run/media/.../Program Files (x86)/Steam/SteamApps/common/Age2HD/"

The above command is an alias for the following python call:

	python3 -m openage.convert media -o ./userassets $PATH_TO_YOUR_AOC_INSTALLATION $(make medialist)


To convert ALL original media files to openage format, execute the following:

	python3 -m openage.convert media -o ./userassets $PATH_TO_YOUR_AOC_INSTALLATION

You will then find the converted files in `./userassets`
the conversion takes some time, so be patient.

The conversion script is multithreaded, but bear in mind that the bottleneck can come from I/O of
your storage device.

By default the script will use all of available CPUs (Python's `os.cpu_count`). You can explicitly
specify amount of processes to spawn for conversion with `-j`/`--jobs` option to `media` command:

	python3 -m openage.convert media -j 666 â€¦

Try

	python3 -m openage.convert --help

to see the convert script usage.
