    /// Perlin noise is the sum of several coherent-noise functions of
    /// ever-increasing frequencies and ever-decreasing amplitudes.
    ///
    /// An important property of Perlin noise is that a small change in the
    /// input value will produce a small change in the output value, while a
    /// large change in the input value will produce a random change in the
    /// output value.
    ///
    /// This noise module outputs Perlin-noise values that usually range from
    /// -1.0 to +1.0, but there are no guarantees that all output values will
    /// exist within that range.
    ///
    /// For a better description of Perlin noise, see the links in the
    /// <i>References and Acknowledgments</i> section.
    ///
    /// This noise module does not require any source modules.
    ///
    /// <b>Octaves</b>
    ///
    /// The number of octaves control the <i>amount of detail</i> of the
    /// Perlin noise.  Adding more octaves increases the detail of the Perlin
    /// noise, but with the drawback of increasing the calculation time.
    ///
    /// An octave is one of the coherent-noise functions in a series of
    /// coherent-noise functions that are added together to form Perlin
    /// noise.
    ///
    /// An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by
    /// calling the SetFrequency() method.
    ///
    /// An application may specify the number of octaves that generate Perlin
    /// noise by calling the SetOctaveCount() method.
    ///
    /// These coherent-noise functions are called octaves because each octave
    /// has, by default, double the frequency of the previous octave.  Musical
    /// tones have this property as well; a musical C tone that is one octave
    /// higher than the previous C tone has double its frequency.
    ///
    /// <b>Frequency</b>
    ///
    /// An application may specify the frequency of the first octave by
    /// calling the SetFrequency() method.
    ///
    /// <b>Persistence</b>
    ///
    /// The persistence value controls the <i>roughness</i> of the Perlin
    /// noise.  Larger values produce rougher noise.
    ///
    /// The persistence value determines how quickly the amplitudes diminish
    /// for successive octaves.  The amplitude of the first octave is 1.0.
    /// The amplitude of each subsequent octave is equal to the product of the
    /// previous octave's amplitude and the persistence value.  So a
    /// persistence value of 0.5 sets the amplitude of the first octave to
    /// 1.0; the second, 0.5; the third, 0.25; etc.
    ///
    /// An application may specify the persistence value by calling the
    /// SetPersistence() method.
    ///
    /// <b>Lacunarity</b>
    ///
    /// The lacunarity specifies the frequency multipler between successive
    /// octaves.
    ///
    /// The effect of modifying the lacunarity is subtle; you may need to play
    /// with the lacunarity value to determine the effects.  For best results,
    /// set the lacunarity to a number between 1.5 and 3.5.
