    After a call to setup(), the C++ interface is in a usable state.

    setup() automatically checks whether there are any remaining un-initialized
    PyFunc objects, and raises an Exception if so.

    Must be invoked before any functions from libopenage are invoked.
    Runs only once; any subsequent invocations are a no-op, so don't hesitate
    to call this method whenever likely.

    Do _not_ invoke from a .pyx extension module that itself provides
    a setup method (circular imports)!
